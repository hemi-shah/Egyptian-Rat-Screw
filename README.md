## Project Description
This project demonstrates my knowledge of game design and development using java.
The game, "ERS," involves a players adding cards to a center pile until either a pattern (doubles, sandwich, top bottom) are played,
or a face card (Jack, Queen, King, Ace) is played. If a special pattern is recognized, a player can slap the pile to receive all cards in the pile.
If a face card is played, the following player has a specified number of chances based on which face card was played by the previous player, and must
play another face card within the number of chances or the previous player receives all cards in the pile. A player loses when they have no cards left,
and wins when they obtain all cards in the deck.
   
## Game Features 
- Doubles: Two cards of the same value are played in a row.
- Sandwich: Two cards of the same value are separated by one card of a different value.
- Top Bottom: The card that was just played (top of the pile) matches the first card played that round (bottom of the pile).
- Face Card Chances: Jack (1), Queen (2), King (3), Ace (4)
