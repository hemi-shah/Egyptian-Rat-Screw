SOURCES
I needed help in finding out how to type cast an int to a String so I looked it up and used the String.valueOf() method. I also used Chat GPT 
to help me find out why two of my variables in my toString() method (String rank & String suit), in the Card class, were not usable in that method without giving me an error.
I also needed help with small lines of code in the Game class where some methods weren't carrying out their full functions, which I used Chat GPT for. Additionally, I made use
of office hours and some lines of code were written by Dr. EEL to help with debugging the play() method in the Game class, specifically to carry out the face-off part. I also
had my current roommate and former CPSC 231 student, Ava DeCristofaro help me with debugging ceratin parts of the code.
